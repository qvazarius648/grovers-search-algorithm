# grovers-search-algorithm
This repository contains a ready-to-run implementation of Grover's algorithm for searching through a list of target keys represented as bit strings. It builds the Grover operator dynamically based on the provided list of solutions and demonstrates how to integrate the oracle and diffusion operator into a full search routine.
